    "This dataset we are going to analyse is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  datasets. It includes time-series data generated by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (attitude, gravity, userAcceleration, and rotationRate). It is collected with an iPhone 6s kept in the participant's front pocket using SensingKit which collects information from Core Motion framework on iOS devices. A total of 24 participants in a range of gender, age, weight, and height performed 6 activities in 15 trials in the same environment and conditions: downstairs, upstairs, walking, jogging, sitting, and standing. With this dataset, authors aim to look for personal attributes fingerprints in time-series of sensor data, i.e. attribute-specific patterns that can be used to infer gender or personality of the data subjects in addition to their activities.\n"

    "For each participant, the study had been commenced by collecting their demographic (age and gender) and physically-related (height and weight) information. Then, they provided them with a dedicated smartphone (iPhone 6) and asked them to store it in their trousers' front pocket during the experiment. All the participant were asked to wear flat shoes. They then asked them to perform 6 different activities (walk downstairs, walk upstairs, sit, stand and jogging) around the [Queen Mary University of London'](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/)s Mile End campus. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each trial, the researcher set up the phone and gave it to the current participants, then the researcher stood in a corner. Then, the participant pressed the start button of Crowdsense app and put it in their trousers' front pocket and performed the specified activity. We asked them to do it as natural as possible, like their everyday life. At the end of each trial, they took the phone out of their pocket and pressed the stop button. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are 24 data subjects. The `A_DeviceMotion_data` folder contains time-series collected by both Accelerometer and Gyroscope for all 15 trials. For every trial we have a multivariate time-series. Thus, we have time-series with 12 features: `attitude.roll`, `attitude.pitch`, `attitude.yaw`, `gravity.x`, `gravity.y`, `gravity.z`, `rotationRate.x`, `rotationRate.y`, `rotationRate.z`, `userAcceleration.x`, `userAcceleration.y`, `userAcceleration.z`.\n",

    "**User acceleration** is the acceleration that the user imparts to the device. Because Core Motion is able to track a device’s attitude using both the gyroscope and the accelerometer, it can differentiate between gravity and user acceleration. A CMDeviceMotion object provides both measurements in the gravity and userAcceleration properties. \n",
