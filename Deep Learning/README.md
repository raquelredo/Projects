Deep Learning Projects
======================

All the projects named below have been made in the context of [Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

Project 01. First Neural Network
--------------------------------

In this project, I'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a bike rental demand dataset The idea is that by building a neural network from the ground up, I'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow.

Project has been challenging for me as it requires to deep more into Python and understanding the maths behind neural network models.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

Project 02. Image Classification
--------------------------------

In this project, I am classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I am normalizing the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.

The data is [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

Project 03. TV Script generation
--------------------------------

In this project, I'll generate my own Simpsons TV script using RNNs. I'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network I'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

Full dataset can be found on Kaggle's database [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data).

Project 04. English-to-french translator
----------------------------------------

I'll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French. I have been provided with the a portion of the English corpus.

Project 05.Face Generator
-------------------------

Using a Generative Adversarial Network I will generate face images.
