**Challenges:** Detect outliers

Indoor localization wifi Footprint
----------------------------------

[clic to go](https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/Indoor%20localization%20Wifi%20Footprint)

Many real world applications need to know the localization of a user in the world to provide their services. Therefore, automatic user localization has been a hot research topic in the last years. Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude, longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. Although, there are some indoor positioning technologies and methodologies, this database is focused on WLAN fingerprint-based ones (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting).

-   Features: 529
-   Observations: 19,937
-   Tuples: 10,546,673

**Challenges:** Reduce data set for downloading time computation | Indoor localization

Kaggle - Titanic survival prediction
------------------------------------

[clic to go](https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/Kaggle%20-%20Titanic%20survival%20prediction)

It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.

-   Features: 11
-   Observations: 891
-   Tuples: 10,692

**Challenges:** Missing values Treatment | Working with text

Association with Market Basket Analysis (MBA)
---------------------------------------------

[clic to go](https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/Association%20-%20Market%20Basket%20analysis)

The main purpose is to analyze the Basket composition from purchase tickets to study how consumers buy products together. This analysis might the foundation base for a cluster customer analysis or a product system recommendation.

-   Type: list of lists
-   Observations: 9835 ticket lists

**Challenges:** Association Analysis per se

Kaggle - 911 Calls
------------------

[clic to go](https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/Kaggle%20-%20911%20Calls%20Data%20exploration)

-   Features: 9
-   Observations: 205,580
-   Tuples: 1,850,220

**Challenges:** Work with different visualization tools | work with Python

LendingClub
-----------

[clic to go](https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/Lendingclub)

For this project I will be exploring a public available data from [LendingClub.com](https://www.lendingclub.com/). Lending Club is a peer to peer lending platform connecting people who need money (the borrower) with people who have the money (investors). As an investor I would want to invest in people who sowed a profile of having a high probability of paying me back. I am going to create a model that will help me to predict this.

I am going to use [data](../inputs/loan_data.csv) from 2007 to 2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. Webpage repository with this data set is [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)

-   Features: 18
-   Observations: 9,578
-   Tuples: 172,404

**Challenges:** ML with Python

NLP - SMS Spam detection
------------------------

[clic to go](https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/NLP%20-%20SMS)

This data set is a compendium from different sources, of SMS classified as Spam /Ham. We will need to build a model that easily can detect when a SMS is relevant or not. Similarly to what, nowadays, spam filters do, NLP tools and techniques will help to do it.

-   Observations: 5,574
-   One label + one string as feature

**Challenges:** Natural Language Processing with Python

=====================================

P01 My first Neural Network
---------------------------

[clic to go](https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/P01%20First-neural-Network)

This project has been done in the context of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s Deep Learning Nano degree. It is my first Neural Network and for that the challenges were multiple. This data set consists on information about a business bike rental. I need to build a NN to predict daily bike rental ridership.

-   Features: 17
-   Observations: 17,380
-   Tuples: 295,460

**Challenges:** My first Neural Network, understanding the concepts: back propagation, forward pass, gradient descent and their programming the math without using any deep learning package.

Banknote authentication
-----------------------

[clic to go](https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/)

This data is the result of a Wavelet transformation on pictures of banknotes. The class to be predicted is whether the bank note has been forget or, on the contrary, it is authentic.

-   Features: 3
-   Observations: 1,372
-   Tuples: 4,116

**Challenges:** use of Tensor Flow
