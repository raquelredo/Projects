Projects
================

This is a brief introduction of some of the projects done. In most cases datasets are public therefore the source is pointed out in the correspondent README file. Enjoy!

Indoor localization wifi Footprint
----------------------------------

\[clic to go\] (<https://github.com/raquelredo/Projects/tree/master/Indoor%20localization%20Wifi%20Footprint>)

Indoor localization is a key topic for mobile computing. However, it is still very difficult for the mobile sensing community to compare state-of-art Indoor Positioning Systems due to the scarcity of publicly available databases. Magnetic field-based methods are becoming an important trend in this research field. Here, we present UJIIndoorLoc-Mag database, which can be used to compare magnetic field-based indoor localization methods. It consists of 270 continuous samples for training and 11 for testing.

-   Features: 520
-   Observations: 40,000
-   Tuples: 520,000

**Challenges:** Reduce dataset for downloading time computation | Indoor localization

Kaggle - Titanic survival prediction
